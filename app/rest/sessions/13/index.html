It can identify real-world failure modes and signal potential avenues of attack that should be plugged before your software ships, often automated or semi-automated, that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data to the inputs of a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, or failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks. Fuzzing is commonly used to test for security problems in software or computer systems.  \r\n \r\nпїЅпїЅпїЅFuzzing is useful for finding bugs in bad code. The number-one mistake application developers make in testing is that they expect data to arrive in a certain order and fuzzing can get round this. But the trick is to know when to stop fuzzing and how to move on to other techniques such as static analysis,пїЅпїЅпїЅ (Brian Chess, chief scientist at Fortify Software and also at RSA,Ref :http://www.theregister.co.uk/Print/2008/04/07/fuzzing_advice/) \r\n\r\nWe have automated the process of fuzzing web services API by chaining them with regular conventional API test programs which use engines like JAX-WS/ AXIS in accessing a remote object via stubs with SOAP (simple object access protocol )communications, and typically used for functional tests. We fuzz them by attaching mutation templates that would parse and mutate the actual SOAP XML prior it reaches the server, at any point in web transaction.\r\n \r\nThis fuzzing technique induces the server to expose lot of its unknown vulnerabilities like Buffer overflows that would lead to crashing or DoS (Denail of service attacks ).\r\n \r\nThe Mutation template is provided with the option injecting / embedding a CDATA/XSS/SQL injections/ XML Schema attacks , all this to happen in a automated fashion either sequentially or in parallel .And further expecting the target to throw proper faults at right time , if not then its considered as a bug .\r\n \r\nAdvantage of this technique is QA folks can reuse their existing API test cases to make them as a data generating engine by sniffing the SOAP body of the specific API they are interested to fuzz at any point in time , which can then be used to feed the fuzz engine to further mutate the SOAP function calls and sending it to the target , this saves lot of data modelling work  which otherwise required, when we use the commercial fuzzing client tools like SOAPUI / WSFuzzer /Peach etc .\r\n  \r\nFollowing this technique early in the development process would help early detection of possible security loop holes , logical flaws ensuring the robustness of the product software more robust.\r\n  \r\n Outline of the Presentation:\r\n  \r\n 1.
