Seriously. AngularJS is however one of the leaders when talking about single-page applications (SPAs). In this talk I will present AngularJS in terms of problems and the solutions it provides to them. I will discuss how traditional concepts of communication between the browser and the server (f.x. data transfer, state management, and user authentication) can be solved using the framework. Furthermore, I will dive into typical pitfalls when developing applications using AngularJS and how one can avoid them.","date":"Nov 26, 2014 12:00:00 AM","track":"Track 1","hasSecret":false}
